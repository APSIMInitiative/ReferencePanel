 - Work through actions
 
Hamish 
 
AI to consider the following five areas of potential future focus/priority at their Steering Committee meeting tomorrow and come back to PFR with a refined view as what future collaborative activity might look like.
1.	Developing horticultural/perennial tree crop functionality in APSIM.
2.	Climate change response functionality in APSIM.
3.	Developing multi-functional landscape capability in APSIM.
4.	Precision agriculture.
5.	Considering high performance computing needs and potential implications.  Recommendation - First step would be to collate what everyone is doing.  To ensure APSIM Infrastruture can deal with the high perforamnce computer.  Keith to start Github repository




### 2.6 Software

Move APSIM Classic into continuous release<br>Comment from Pete deV - For the forseeable future, the Apsim Classic release will remain at 7.10, and links to upgrade to the latest bugfix are available to developers only via the bootleg system on bob. This means registered users don't have a) knowlege of available bugfixes, and b) access to them. I'm proposing some sort of notification system to registered users: some of these bugfixes have serious impact. 
  
  This may entail a list of registered users being kept on bob so that when (if?) a bugfix release is built, users are notified.
  
  The RP may wish to discuss how this continually changing version should be "referenced".
